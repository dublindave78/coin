What is MMM?
--------------------

MMM is a fork of the Bitcoin core project. It contains its own
set up of certain parameters, such as block times and extra features such
as enhanced mining difficulty calculations, protection against 51% attacks
and its own hashing algorithm.

MMM is an open source project and additional changes and fixes to those in
the source code are managed by the community.

What is MMM?
----------------

MMM is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. MMM uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. MMM Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the MMM Core software, see these [downloads](https://github.com/fiscalobject/mmm/releases).
